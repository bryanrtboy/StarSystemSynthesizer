# StarSystemSynthesizer
 
This is a project to learn to use the new UI Toolkit to build an editor and runtime UI for an experimental synth/step sequencer. Note, there is no audio in this project, just the two UI systems and scripts to create orbiting object and cubes that serve as note-making collisions.
 
Documentation for the UI Toolkit is sparse, but I was very fortunate to find [this blog post](https://a2i2.deakin.edu.au/2020/04/03/creating-a-uielements-custom-inspector-in-unity/) not only describing how to make an interface, it was making a solar system-type interface as well! Super helpful and also allowed me to get into making scriptable objects for the first time. The [Unity Royale Demo](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/UIToolkitUnityRoyaleRuntimeDemo)
is so complex it's hard to figure out how to implement a simple button or slider.
